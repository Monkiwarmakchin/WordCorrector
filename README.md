# WordCorrector
Program that takes a string, compares it to all the words in a dictionary, and tries to give you suggestions as to which word you tried to type. The algorithm was made from scratch and the sensitivity of the parameters that it takes into account can be modified by changing the global variables. Made in PHP.

The two base dictionaries for this program have been added. "DiccionarioGrande.txt" is the default option, but you can even add your own dictionaries just by changing the corresponding variable.
